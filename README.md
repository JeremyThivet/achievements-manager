## Project status

ℹ️ This project is developed for self-education purpose, I wanted to put in practice my knowledge of Ruby on Rails.

I tried to stick with the convention over configuration but wanted to evolve the architecture a bit to better decouple responsabilities among differents components. The project's structure is mainly inspired by the UpGrow project, you can have a look at these resources:
